Teenytinylinks is a simple free to use Linktree alternative, that I created to avoid paying any subscription fees for such platforms.

Idea: A simple editable JSON file, that holds your link data, and the js fetches this info to display on the website.

Icons are preconfigured, to be displayed automatically as per the data in JSON. (more icons to be added later)
